All Factors العوامل

Write a method named printFactors with one parameter of type int named number.
If number is < 1, the method should print "Invalid Value".
The method should print all factors of the number. A factor of a number is an integer which divides that number
wholly (without leaving a remainder).
For example, 3 is a factor of 6 because 3 fully divides 6 without leaving a remainder. In other words 6 / 3 = 2.

 EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
 * printFactors(6); → should print 1 2 3 6
   6 / 1 = 6  | 6 / 2 = 3 | 6 / 3 = 2 | 6 / 4 = 1.5 | 6 / 5 = 1.2 | 6 / 6 = 1
 * printFactors(32); → should print 1 2 4 8 16 32
 * printFactors(10); → should print 1 2 5 10
 * printFactors(-1); → should print "Invalid Value" since number is < 1
